# sparse-accelerator
This repository implements FASE (Format-Adaptive Sparse Engine), a high-performance C++ accelerator for sparse matrix operations targeting Graph Neural Network (GNN) inference. It dynamically chooses between multiple sparse matrix formats (CSR, ELL, BCSR) based on sparsity patterns to maximize execution efficiency.
